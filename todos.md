# TO-DO's

### Code:
 1. Fix up CSS for UI and fill JS canvas as blank background.
 2. Add basic data structures & objects for board and cells.
 3. Add game logic using data structures & objects to simulate the cells.
 4. Add event handlers for game buttons: Pause, Reset, and Place (Cell).
 5. Optional: Add a SaveManager class storing presets for the board.
   - Serializes board cells as JSON in `localStorage` and can unpack them later.
